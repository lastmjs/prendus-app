# Welcome to Graphcool!

# This file is the main config file for your Graphcool Project.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# We've included a hello world function here.
# Just uncomment it and run `graphcool deploy`
#
# Check out some examples:
#    github.com/graphcool/examples

# Here are the reference docs of this definition format:
