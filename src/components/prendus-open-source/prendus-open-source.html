           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

        # brace-expansion

        [Brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Brace-Expansion.html),
        as known from sh/bash, in JavaScript.

        [![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion)

        ## Example

        ```js
        var expand = require('brace-expansion');

        expand('file-{a,b,c}.jpg')
        // => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

        expand('-v{,,}')
        // => ['-v', '-v', '-v']

        expand('file{0..2}.jpg')
        // => ['file0.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file2.jpg']

        expand('file-{a..c}.jpg')
        // => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-b.jpg', 'file-c.jpg']

        expand('file{2..0}.jpg')
        // => ['file2.jpg', 'file1.jpg', 'file0.jpg']

        expand('file{0..4..2}.jpg')
        // => ['file0.jpg', 'file2.jpg', 'file4.jpg']

        expand('file-{a..e..2}.jpg')
        // => ['file-a.jpg', 'file-c.jpg', 'file-e.jpg']

        expand('file{00..10..5}.jpg')
        // => ['file00.jpg', 'file05.jpg', 'file10.jpg']

        expand('{{A..C},{a..c}}')
        // => ['A', 'B', 'C', 'a', 'b', 'c']

        expand('ppp{,config,oe{,conf}}')
        // => ['ppp', 'pppconfig', 'pppoe', 'pppoeconf']
        ```

        ## API

        ```js
        var expand = require('brace-expansion');
        ```

        ### var expanded = expand(str)

        Return an array of all possible and valid expansions of `str`. If none are
        found, `[str]` is returned.

        Valid expansions are:

        ```js
        /^(.*,)+(.+)?$/
        // {a,b,...}
        ```

        A comma seperated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.

        ```js
        /^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
        // {x..y[..incr]}
        ```

        A numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
        If `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded
        to have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.

        ```js
        /^-?\d+\.\.-?\d+(\.\.-?\d+)?$/
        // {x..y[..incr]}
        ```

        An alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.
        `x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a
        number.

        For compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.

        ## Installation

        With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

        ```bash
        npm install brace-expansion
        ```

        # <img width="300" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/chalk/77ae94f63ab1ac61389b190e5a59866569d1a376/logo.svg" alt="chalk">

        > Terminal string styling done right

        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/chalk)
        ![](http://img.shields.io/badge/unicorn-approved-ff69b4.svg)

        [colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) is currently the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending String.prototype which causes all kinds of [problems](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68). Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.

        **Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.**

        ![screenshot](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles/raw/master/screenshot.png)


        ## Why

        - Highly performant
        - Doesn't extend String.prototype
        - Expressive API
        - Ability to nest styles
        - Clean and focused
        - Auto-detects color support
        - Actively maintained
        - [Used by 1000+ modules](https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/chalk)


        ## Install

        ```sh
        $ npm install --save chalk
        ```


        ## Usage

        Chalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.

        ```js
        var chalk = require('chalk');

        // style a string
        console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello world!')  );

        // combine styled and normal strings
        console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello'), 'World' + chalk.red('!')  );

        // compose multiple styles using the chainable API
        console.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );

        // pass in multiple arguments
        console.log(  chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz')  );

        // nest styles
        console.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!')  );

        // nest styles of the same type even (color, underline, background)
        console.log(  chalk.green('I am a green line ' + chalk.blue('with a blue substring') + ' that becomes green again!')  );
        ```

        Easily define your own themes.

        ```js
        var chalk = require('chalk');
        var error = chalk.bold.red;
        console.log(error('Error!'));
        ```

        Take advantage of console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data).

        ```js
        var name = 'Sindre';
        console.log(chalk.green('Hello %s'), name);
        //=> Hello Sindre
        ```


        ## API

        ### chalk.`[....](string, [string...])`

        Example: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`

        Chain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter.

        Multiple arguments will be separated by space.

        ### chalk.enabled

        Color support is automatically detected, but you can override it.

        ### chalk.supportsColor

        Detect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/supports-color).

        Can be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`.

        Used internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.

        ### chalk.styles

        Exposes the styles as [ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles).

        Generally not useful, but you might need just the `.open` or `.close` escape code if you're mixing externally styled strings with yours.

        ```js
        var chalk = require('chalk');

        console.log(chalk.styles.red);
        //=> {open: '\u001b[31m', close: '\u001b[39m'}

        console.log(chalk.styles.red.open + 'Hello' + chalk.styles.red.close);
        ```

        ### chalk.hasColor(string)

        Check whether a string [has color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-ansi).

        ### chalk.stripColor(string)

        [Strip color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi) from a string.

        Can be useful in combination with `.supportsColor` to strip color on externally styled text when it's not supported.

        Example:

        ```js
        var chalk = require('chalk');
        var styledString = getText();

        if (!chalk.supportsColor) {
        	styledString = chalk.stripColor(styledString);
        }
        ```


        ## Styles

        ### General

        - `reset`
        - `bold`
        - `dim`
        - `italic` *(not widely supported)*

        deep-is
        0.1.2 <https://github.com/thlorenz/deep-is>
        deep-is
        ==========

        Node's `assert.deepEqual() algorithm` as a standalone module. Exactly like
        [deep-equal](https://github.com/substack/node-deep-equal) except for the fact that `deepEqual(NaN, NaN) === true`.

        This module is around [5 times faster](https://gist.github.com/2790507)
        than wrapping `assert.deepEqual()` in a `try/catch`.

                { x : 5, y : 6 }
            )
        ]);
        ```

        methods
        =======

        var deepIs = require('deep-is')

        deepIs(a, b)
        ---------------

        Compare objects `a` and `b`, returning whether they are equal according to a
        recursive equality algorithm.

        install
        =======

        # intersect

        [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/intersect.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/intersect)
        [![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/intersect.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/intersect)

        [![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/intersect.png)](https://ci.testling.com/juliangruber/intersect)

        ## Usage

        ```js
        var intersect = require('intersect');

        var a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];
        var b = ['nope', 'bar', 'baz'];

        console.log(intersect(a, b));
        // => ['bar', 'baz']
        ```

        ## Installation

        With [npm](http://npmjs.org) do

        ```bash
        $ npm install intersect
        ```

        With [component](https://github.com/component/component) do

        ```bash
        $ component install juliangruber/intersect
        ```

        ## API

        ### intersect(a, b)

        Find the intersection of arrays `a` and `b`. The individual arrays are expected to be sets, i.e. there's no duplicate elements in them.

        ### intersect(arrays)

        You can also pass an array of arrays as a single argument, to get the intersection of `n` arrays.

        ### intersect.big(a, b)

        This module contains an alternative intersection algorithm by @minuteman3, better suited for intersecting big arrays.

        The implementations *might* compare like this, depending on your host environment:

        nopt-usage
        0.1.0 <>
        # Show usage

        This module generates a usage string for nopt options. It's based on [this](https://github.com/npm/nopt/pull/13) PR from Filirom1.

        ```
        var noptUsage = require('nopt-usage');
        noptUsage(knownOpts, shortHands, description1, description2, ...)
        ```
        ## install

            npm install nopt-usage

        ## example

        You could pass as many description objects as you want. Take a look at the following example to understand how it could be used.

        ```
        #!/usr/bin/env node

        var nopt = require("nopt")
          , noptUsage = require("nopt-usage")
          , Stream = require("stream").Stream
          , path = require("path")
          , knownOpts = { "foo" : [String, null]
                        , "bar" : [Stream, Number]
                        , "baz" : path
                        , "bloo" : [ "big", "medium", "small" ]
                        , "flag" : Boolean
                        , "pick" : Boolean
                        }
          , shortHands = { "foofoo" : ["--foo", "Mr. Foo"]
                         , "b7" : ["--bar", "7"]

                          , "bar" : "A bar thing"
                          , "baz" : "More or less baz"
                          , "flag" : "Flag it as well"
                          , "pick" : "Or pick something"
                          }
          , defaults = { "foo" : null
                       , "bar" : 42
                       , "baz" : "/etc/passwd"
                       , "bloo" : "small"
                       , "pick" : false
                       }
                     // everything is optional.
                     // knownOpts and shorthands default to {}
                     // arg list defaults to process.argv
                     // slice defaults to 2
          , parsed = nopt(knownOpts, shortHands, process.argv, 2)
          , usage = noptUsage(knownOpts, shortHands, description, defaults)

        console.log('Usage: ')
        console.log(usage)
        ```

        The output is:

        ```
        Usage:
            --foo, -foofoo        Something really foooooooo    null

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

        raptor-args
        1.0.3 <https://github.com/raptorjs/raptor-args>
        raptor-args
        ===========
        A flexible and simple command line arguments parser that generates friendly help messages.

        # Installation
        ```bash
        npm install raptor-args --save
        ```

        # Usage

        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        var parser = require('raptor-args').createParser(options);
        var parsed = parser.parse(argsArray);

        // parsed will be an object with properties corresponding to provided arguments
        ```

        ## Simple Example

        Parse arguments provided by `process.argv`:

        Given the following JavaScript code to parse the args:
        ```javascript
        // Create a parser and parse process.argv
        require('raptor-args').createParser({
                '--foo -f': 'boolean',
                '--bar -b': 'string'
            })
            .parse();
        ```

        And the following command:
        ```bash
        node app.js --foo -b b
        ```

        The output will be:

        ```javascript
        //Output:
        {
            foo: true,
            bar: 'baz'
        }
        ```

        You can also parse your own array of arguments instead of using `process.argv`:

        ```javascript
        // Create a parser and parse provided args
        require('raptor-args').createParser({
                '--foo -f': 'boolean',
                '--bar -b': 'string'
            })
            .parse(['--foo', '-b', 'baz']);

        //Output:
        {
            foo: true,
            bar: 'baz'
        }
        ```

        You can also be more descriptive and add usage, examples, error handlers and validation checks:
        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        require('raptor-args')
            .createParser({
                '--help': {
                    type: 'string',
                    description: 'Show this help message'
                },
                '--foo -f': {
                    type: 'string',
                    description: 'Some helpful description for "foo"'
                },
                '--bar -b': {
                    type: 'string',
                    description: 'Some helpful description for "bar"'
                }
            })
            .usage('Usage: $0 [options]')
            .example(
                'First example',
                '$0 --foo hello')
            .example(
                'Second example',
                '$0 --foo hello --bar world')
            .validate(function(result) {
                if (result.help) {
                    this.printUsage();
                    process.exit(0);
                }

                if (!result.foo || !result.bar) {
                    this.printUsage();
                    console.log('--foo or --bar is required');
                    process.exit(1);
                }
            })
            .onError(function(err) {
                this.printUsage();
                console.error(err);
                process.exit(1);
            })
            .parse();
        ```

        Running the above program with the `--help` argument will produce the following output:

        ```
        Usage: args [options]

        Examples:

          First example:
             args --foo hello

          Second example:
             args --foo hello --bar world

        Options:

          --help Show this help message [string]

        --foo -f Some helpful description for "foo" [string]

        --bar -b Some helpful description for "bar" [string]
        ```


        ## Aliases

        Aliases can be provided as space-separated values for an option:
        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        var parser = require('raptor-args').createParser({
            '--foobar --foo -f': 'string', // "--foobar" has two aliases: "--foo" and "-f"
            '--hello -h': 'string',        // "--hello" has one alias: "-h"
        });

        parser.parse('--foo FOO -h HELLO'.split(' '));
        // Output:
        {
            foobar: 'FOO',
            hello: 'HELLO'
        }

        // **NOTE**: Only the first entry is used to determine the target property name--not the aliases.
        ```

        ## Booleans

        An argument value of "true" or "false" is automatically converted to the corresponding boolean type. If a argument is prefixed with "no-" then it will be set to `false`.

        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        var parser = require('raptor-args').createParser({
            '--foo': 'boolean',
            '--bar': 'boolean'
        });

        parser.parse('--foo --no-bar'.split(' '));
        // Output:
        {
            foo: true,
            bar: false
        }
        ```

        ## Arrays

        Any argument with multiple values will result in an `Array` value, but if you want to force an array for a single value then you can append "[]" to the option type as shown in the following sample code:
        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        var parser = require('raptor-args').createParser({
            '--foo': 'string[]'
        });

        parser.parse('--foo a'.split(' '));
        // Output:
        {
            foo: ['a']
        }

        parser.parse('--foo a b c'.split(' '));
        // Output:
        {
            foo: ['a', 'b', 'c']
        }
        ```

        ## Wildcards

        A parser will throw an error for unrecognized arguments unless wildcards are used as shown in the examples below.

        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        var parser = require('raptor-args').createParser({
            '--foo -f *': 'string[]' // Any unrecognized argument at the beginning is an alias for "foo"
        });

        parser.parse('a b --foo c'.split(' '));
        // Output:
        {
            foo: ['a', 'b', 'c']
        }
        ```

        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        var parser = require('raptor-args').createParser({
            '*': null
        });

        parser.parse('a b --foo FOO --bar BAR'.split(' '));
        // Output:
        {
            '*': ['a', 'b'],
            foo: 'FOO',
            bar: 'BAR'
        }
        ```

        ## Complex Types

        Square brackets can be used to begin and end complex types:

        ```javascript
        // Create a parser:
        var parser = require('raptor-args').createParser({
            '--foo -f': 'boolean',
            '--plugins --plugin -p': {
                options: {
                    '--module -m *': 'string',
                    '-*': null
                }
            }
        });

        var parsed = parser.parse('--foo --plugins [ --module plugin1 -x -y ] [ plugin2 -z Hello ]'.split(' '));

        // Output:
        {
            foo: true,
            plugins: [
                {
                    module: 'plugin1',
                    x: true,
                    y: true
                },
                {
                    module: 'plugin2',
                    z: 'Hello'
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        1.0.0 <https://github.com/sindresorhus/slash>
        # slash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/slash)

        > Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: `foo\\bar` ➔ `foo/bar`

        [Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they're not extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.

        This was created since the `path` methods in Node outputs `\\` paths on Windows.


        ## Install

        ```sh
        $ npm install --save slash
        ```


        ## Usage

        ```js
        var path = require('path');
        var slash = require('slash');

        var str = path.join('foo', 'bar');
        // Unix    => foo/bar
        // Windows => foo\\bar

        slash(str);
        // Unix    => foo/bar
        // Windows => foo/bar
        ```


        ## API

        ### slash(path)

        Type: `string`

        Accepts a Windows backslash path and returns a slash path.

           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

           1. Definitions.

              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.

           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

        treeify
        1.0.1 <https://github.com/notatestuser/treeify>
        treeify [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/notatestuser/node-treeify.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/notatestuser/node-treeify)
        =======

        _treeify_ converts a JS object into a nice, visible depth-indented tree for console printing. The structure
        generated is similar to what you get by running the ```tree``` command on Unixy platforms.

        ```
        {
            oranges: {
                'mandarin': {                                          ├─ oranges
                    clementine: null,                                  │  └─ mandarin
                    tangerine: 'so cheap and juicy!'        -=>        │     ├─ clementine
                }                                                      │     └─ tangerine: so cheap and juicy!
            },                                                         └─ apples
            apples: {                                                     ├─ gala
                'gala': null,                                             └─ pink lady
                'pink lady': null
            }
        }
        ```

        It also works well with larger nested hierarchies such as file system directory trees.
        In fact, the ```fs_tree``` example does a pretty good job of imitating ```tree```. Try it out!

        See the other included examples or the test suite for usage scenarios.

        Getting it
        ----------

        ### For use with node.js

        First you'll want to run this command in your project's root folder:
        ```
        $ npm install treeify
        ```

        Then proceed to use it in your project:
        ```js
        var treeify = require('treeify');
        console.log(
           treeify.asTree({
              apples: 'gala',      //  ├─ apples: gala
              oranges: 'mandarin'  //  └─ oranges: mandarin
           }, true)
        );
        ```

        ### For use in a browser

        Treeify cooperates with Node, AMD or browser globals to create a module. This means it'll work
        in a browser regardless of whether you have an AMD-compliant module loader or not. If such
        a loader isn't found when the script is executed, you may access Treeify at ```window.treeify```.

        Usage
        -----

        The methods exposed to you are as follows, in a strange kind of signature notation:

        ### asLines()
        ```js
        treeify.asLines(obj, showValues (boolean), [hideFunctions (boolean),] lineCallback (function))
        // NOTE: hideFunctions is optional and may be safely omitted - this was done to ensure we don't break uses of the previous form
        ```
        ### asTree()
        ```js
        treeify.asTree(obj, showValues (boolean), hideFunctions (boolean)): String
        ```

        Running the tests
        -----------------

        There's a pretty extensive suite of Vows tests included.
        ```
        $ npm test
        ```

        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
        limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
        conversions to other media types.

        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
        form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
        notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is
        provided in the Appendix below).

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
        version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
        Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor
        for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or
        Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For
        the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
        electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
        representatives, including but not limited to communication on
        electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
        tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for
        the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
        communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
        writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
        behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
        license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
        publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
        Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
        License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
        this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
        sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
        applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
        are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
        combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
        against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
        lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
        the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
        any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
        shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
        or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
        following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
        copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
        distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
        from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
        a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
        file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
        Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
        Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
        NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
        License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
        text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
        cannot be construed as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
        provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
        in this License.

        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
        You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
        License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the
        above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
        separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding
        such Contributions.

        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
        to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
        its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
        OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
        any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
        redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
        exercise of permissions under this License.

        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
        required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
        acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
        for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
        consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
        License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
        not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
        losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
        such damages.

        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
        fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
        accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
        Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
        only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
        harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
        Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
        liability.

              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and

              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and

              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.

           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

        ## Description

        This module evaluates the generated code from [math-codegen](https://github.com/maurizzzio/math-codegen)
        for the built in `Math` namespace providing the necessary adapter methods

        ## Installation

        ```sh
        $ npm install --save built-in-math-eval
        ```

        ## API

        ```javascript
        var compile = require('built-in-math-eval');
        ```

        ### `code = compile(expression)`

        **params**
        * `expression` {string} the expression to be parsed

        **returns** {Object}
        * `return.eval` {function} The compiled function to be called with some scope variables

        #### `return.eval([scope])`

        **params**
        * `scope` {Object}

        An optional object which holds some variables to be used in the expression,
        all variables are casted to `Number`

        **returns** {*} a number or a boolean value depending on the operation made

        ## Examples

        Also have a look at [test/index.js](https://github.com/maurizzzio/built-in-math-eval/blob/master/test/index.js)

        ```javascript
        var compile = require('built-in-math-eval');

        // > 3
        compile('1 + 2').eval()

        // > 8
        compile('2^3').eval()

        // > 8
        compile('x^3').eval({ x: 2 })

        // > 1
        compile('cos(x)').eval({ x: 0 })

        // > 8
        compile('2x^2').eval({ x: 2 })

        // > 3.1415
        compile('PI').eval()
        ```

        2. License Grants and Conditions

        2.1. Grants

             Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
             non-exclusive license:

             a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
                Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
                modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
                Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
                part of a Larger Work; and

             b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
                sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
                or its Contributor Version.

        2.2. Effective Date

             The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
             effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
             such Contribution.

        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

             The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
             License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
             or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
             2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

             a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

             b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
                modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
                Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
                Version); or

             c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
                Contributions.

             This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
             logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
             notice requirements in Section 3.4).

        2.4. Subsequent Licenses

             No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
             distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
             (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
             under the terms of Section 3.3).

        2.5. Representation

             Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
             are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
             rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

        2.6. Fair Use

             This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
             copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

        2.7. Conditions

             Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
             Section 2.1.


        3. Responsibilities

        3.1. Distribution of Source Form

             All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
             Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
             terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
             of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
             they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
             restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

             If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

             a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
                as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
                Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
                reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
                of distribution to the recipient; and

             b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
                or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
                the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
                rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

             You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
             provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
             Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
             with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
             Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
             You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
             such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
             their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
             either this License or such Secondary License(s).

        3.4. Notices

             You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
             copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
             of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
             Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
             required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

        3.5. Application of Additional Terms

             You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
             indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
             Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
             of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
             warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
             alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
             liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
             indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
             disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
             jurisdiction.

        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

           If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
           with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
           order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
           to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
           they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
           distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
           extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
           sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
           understand it.

        5. Termination

        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
             fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
             then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
             are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
             explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
             if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
             reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
             Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
             ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
             some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
             non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
             compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
             infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
             and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
             indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
             all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
             shall terminate.

        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
             license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
             validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
             termination shall survive termination.

        6. Disclaimer of Warranty

           Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
           warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
           without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
           merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
           risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
           Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
           Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
           correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
           License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
           except under this disclaimer.

        7. Limitation of Liability

           Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
           negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
           distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
           direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
           character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
           goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
           other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
           informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
           shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
           party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
           Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
           consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

        8. Litigation

           Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
           a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
           and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
           reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
           prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

        9. Miscellaneous

           This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
           hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
           provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
           enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
           contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
           this License against a Contributor.


        10. Versions of the License

        10.1. New Versions

              Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
              10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
              publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
              distinguishing version number.

        10.2. Effect of New Versions

              You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
              the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or

              create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
              version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
              references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
              modified license differs from this License).

        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
              If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

        > A  2d function plotter powered by d3

        Function Plot is a powerful library built on top of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> whose purpose
        is to render functions with little configuration (think of it as a little clone of Google's plotting
        utility: [y = x * x](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=y+%3D+x+%5E+2)

        The library currently supports interactive line charts and scatterplots, whenever the graph scale is modified the function
        is evaluated again with the new bounds, result: infinite graphs!

        **NOTE: function-plot requires d3 v3: [see this issue to keep track of the upgrade status](https://github.com/mauriciopoppe/function-plot/issues/79)**

        [**homepage**](http://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/)

        ## Install

        ```sh
        $ npm install --save function-plot
        ```

        ## Usage with browserify

        ```js
        var d3 = window.d3
        var functionPlot = require('function-plot');
        functionPlot({
          // options below
        })
        ```

        ## Example

        All the available options are described in the [`homepage`](http://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/)

        ## API

        ```
        var functionPlot = require('function-plot');
        ```

        this array
        * `instance.meta` {object}
          * `instance.meta.margin` {object} graph's left,right,top,bottom margins

        events can be triggered by doing `instance.emit([eventName][, params])`

        * `mouseover` fired whenever the mouse is over the canvas
        * `mousemove` fired whenever the mouse is moved inside the canvas, callback params: a single object `{x: number, y: number}` (in canvas space
        coordinates)
        * `mouseout` fired whenever the mouse is moved outside the canvas
        * `before:draw` fired before drawing all the graphs
        * `after:draw` fired after drawing all the graphs
        * `zoom:scaleUpdate` fired whenever the scale of another graph is updated, callback params `xScale`, `yScale`
        (x-scale and y-scale of another graph whose scales were updated)
        * `tip:update` fired whenever the tip position is updated, callback params `x`, `y`, `index` (in canvas
        space coordinates, `index` is the index of the graph where the tip is on top of)
        * `eval` fired whenever the sampler evaluates a function, callback params `data` (an array of segment/points),
        `index` (the index of datum in the `data` array), `isHelper` (true if the data is created for a helper e.g.
        for the derivative/secant)

        The following events are dispatched to all the linked graphs

        * `all:mouseover` same as `mouseover` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
        * `all:mousemove` same as `mousemove` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
        * `all:mouseout` same as `mouseout` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
        * `all:zoom:scaleUpdate` same as `zoom:scaleUpdate` but it's dispatched in each linked graph
        * `all:zoom` fired whenever there's scaling/translation on the graph, dispatched on all the linked graphs

        When the `definite-integral` plugin is included the instance will fire the following events

        * `definite-integral`
          * `datum` {object} The datum whose definite integral was computed
          * `i` {number} The index of the datum in the `data` array
          * `value` {number} The value of the definite integral
          * `a` {number} the left endpoint of the interval
          * `b` {number} the right endpoint of the interval

        ## Recipes

        ### Evaluate a function at some value `x`

        ```javascript
        var y = functionPlot.eval.builtIn(datum, fnProperty, scope)
        ```

        Where `datum` is an object that has a function to be evaluated in the property `fnProperty` ,
        to eval this function we need an `x` value which is sent through the scope

        e.g.

        ```javascript
        var datum = {
          fn: 'x^2'
        }
        var scope = {
          x: 2
        }
        var y = functionPlot.eval.builtIn(datum, 'fn', scope)
        ```

        Every element of the `data` property sent to `functionPlot` is saved on `instance.options.data`,
        if you want to get the evaluated values of all the elements here run

        ```javascript
        var instance = functionPlot( ... )
        instance.options.data.forEach(function (datum) {
          var datum = {
            fn: 'x^2'
          }
          var scope = {
            // a value for x
            x: 2
          }
          var y = functionPlot.eval.builtIn(datum, 'fn', scope)
        }
        ```

        ### Programmatic zoom

        Just call `instance.programmaticZoom` with the desired `x` and `y` domains

        ```javascript
        var instance = functionPlot( ... )
        var xDomain = [-3, 3]
        var yDomain = [-1.897, 1.897]
        instance.programmaticZoom(xDomain, yDomain)
        ```

        ### Maintain aspect ratio

        Given the `xDomain` values you can compute the corresponding `yDomain` values to main
        the aspect ratio between the axes

        ```javascript
        function computeYScale (width, height, xScale) {
          var xDiff = xScale[1] - xScale[0]
          var yDiff = height * xDiff / width
          return [-yDiff / 2, yDiff / 2]
        }

        var width = 800
        var height = 400

        // desired xDomain values
        var xScale = [-10, 10]

        functionPlot({
          width: width,
          height: height,
          xDomain: xScale,
          yDomain: computeYScale(width, height, xScale),

          target: '#demo',
          data: [{
            fn: 'x^2',
            derivative: {
              fn: '2x',
              updateOnMouseMove: true
            }
          }]
        })
        ```

        ### Changing the format of the values shown on the axes

        ```javascript
        var instance = functionPlot({
          target: '#complex-plane',
          xLabel: 'real',
          yLabel: 'imaginary'
        })
        // old format
        var format = instance.meta.yAxis.tickFormat()
        var imaginaryFormat = function (d) {
          // new format = old format + ' i' for imaginary
          return format(d) + ' i'
        }
        // update format
        instance.meta.yAxis.tickFormat(imaginaryFormat)
        // redraw the graph
        instance.draw()
        ```

        ### Styling

        Selectors (sass)

        ```sass
        .function-plot {
          .x.axis {
            .tick {
              line {
                // grid's vertical lines
              }
              text {
                // x axis labels
              }
            }
            path.domain {
              // d attribute defines the graph bounds
            }
          }

          .y.axis {
            .tick {
              line {
                // grid's horizontal lines
              }
              text {
                // y axis labels
              }
            }
            path.domain {
              // d attribute defines the graph bounds
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        ```javascript
        compile(expression).eval(scope)

        // e.g.
        compile('1').eval({});        // { lo: 1, hi: 1 }
        compile('x').eval({x: 1})     // { lo: 1, hi: 1 }
        ```

        ### Basic operations
        ```javascript
        1
        >  { lo: 1, hi: 1 }

        // unary minus
        -1
        >  { lo: -1, hi: -1 }

        // floating point error is carried over in the operations
        -1 + 3
        >  { lo: 1.9999999999999998, hi: 2.0000000000000004 }

        // [1, 1] / [3, 3]
        1 / 3
        >  { lo: 0.33333333333333326, hi: 0.33333333333333337 }

        -1 / 3
        >  { lo: -0.33333333333333337, hi: -0.33333333333333326 }

        -(1 / 3)

        -1 / -3
        >  { lo: 0.33333333333333326, hi: 0.33333333333333337 }

        2 * 3
        >  { lo: 5.999999999999999, hi: 6.000000000000001 }

        [1, 2]
        >  { lo: 1, hi: 2 }

        -[1, 2]
        >  { lo: -2, hi: -1 }

        [1, 2] + [-1, 2]
        >  { lo: -5e-324, hi: 4.000000000000001 }

        // means [1, 2] + [-2, 1]
        [1, 2] - [-1, 2]
        >  { lo: -1.0000000000000002, hi: 3.0000000000000004 }

        [1, 2] * [-1, 2]
        >  { lo: -2.0000000000000004, hi: 4.000000000000001 }

        [1, 2] / [2, 3]
        >  { lo: 0.33333333333333326, hi: 1.0000000000000002 }

        // if the upper interval has zero the result will also contain a zero

        ## Description

        `mr-parser` is a lightweight mathematical parser inspired by [math.js expression parser][math-js], unlike [math.js expression parser][math-js] the AST nodes contain no info on how to compile a node which makes the parser modular

        ### why?

        I felt that I had to make another parser because:

        - [math-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/math-parser) is too simple for me, it just operates on numbers and has the following operators `+, -, *, / and ^` and doesn't have variable substitution
        - [math.js expression parser][math-js] is perfect but it's not modularized yet, to use it one would have to include all the source code of math.js
        - [math.js expression parser][math-js] AST nodes have info about how to compile a node, I think it's better to let another module do that

        ### Grammar

        ```text
        program          : block (; block)*

        block            : assignment

        assignment       : ternary
                         | symbol `=` assignment

                         | logicalOR `?` ternary `:` ternary

        logicalOR        : logicalXOR
                         | logicalXOR (`||`,`or`) logicalOR

        shift            : additive
                         | additive (`>>` | `<<` | `>>>`) shift

                         : end

        end              : null-token

        ## Install

        ```sh
        $ npm install --save mr-parser
        ```

        ## Usage

        ```js
        var Parser = require('mr-parser').Parser;
        Parser.parse('1 * (2 + 3) * 4')

        // returns
        {
          blocks:[{
            op: '*',
            args: [{
              value: '1',
              valueType: 'number'
            }, {
              op: '*',
              args: [{
                op: '+',
                args: [
                  { value: '2', valueType: 'number' },
                  { value: '3', valueType: 'number' }
                ]
              }, {

        vkey
        0.0.3 <https://github.com/chrisdickinson/vkey>
        # vkey

        virtual `keyCode` to human name mapping. let's team up to quash all of the `keyCode` inconsistencies that we can!

        ```javascript

        var vkey = require('vkey')

        document.body.addEventListener('keydown', function(ev) {
          console.log(vkey[ev.keyCode])
        }, false)

        ```

        cobbled together from [Benvie's Keyboard](https://github.com/Benvie/Keyboard) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/KeyboardEvent).

        ## contributing / making life better for everyone

        **EASY MODE, Step 0**: Visit [the test page](http://didact.us/vkey/). Go to **Step 2**.

        **Step 1**: get the repo and run the test site.

        ```bash
        $ git clone git://github.com/chrisdickinson/vkey.git
        $ cd vkey.git
        $ npm install --dev .
        $ npm start
        $ # open localhost:3030

        ```

        **Step 2**: open the site in all the browsers you have at your command!
        mash keys! note inconsistencies!

        **Step 3**: open an issue with:

        1. your operating system
        2. the browser + version
        3. (as best as you can describe), what kind of keyboard you're using. images welcome! crude drawings of keyboards less welcome, but still a little welcome.
        4. what key you pressed
        5. what result you expected
        6. what result you got

        **Step 3, HARD MODE**: open a pull request with all of the above, and a minimally invasive fix!

        ## deviations thus far

        * meta left and right are reduced to `<meta>`, because no one really seems to support it correctly.
        * `<unk>` is coerced to `<menu>` on OSX, since it has no idea what that button is (using a dell keyboard.)
